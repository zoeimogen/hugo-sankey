# Visualising the Hugo Awards 2024

## How does this work?

Voting on Hugo and related award finalists is the fairly simple
"[Alternative Vote](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/alternative-vote/)"
system, also known as "Instant Runoff Voting" in the United States.
In this system, voters simply rank their choices and the candidate
with the least first-placed votes is eliminated, with those ballots
going to the second-placed candidate. This can seem quite complicated, but
it ensures winners have broad support and  Sankey diagrams such as these
should make it clear how it all works.

More critically, these graphs show the importance of voting for all the
candidates you have a preference for: in several cases, the winner was not
the person or work with the most first preferences. Nerds of a Feather and Saga 11
both won despite placing third in first preferences.

Nominations are run on the E Pluribus Hugo system, which is similar in principle
(run multiple rounds and eliminate last place) but with changes to cope with the
fact that nominations are unranked. In short, you get one point which is split amongst
your nominations in a given category so if you have one nomination, it gets one point,
two nominations would get half a point each and so on.

If you think all this is overly complicated and unnecessary - it's not. The right-wing
[Sad Puppies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sad_Puppies) campaign succeded in
getting their nomination slates as finalists under the precursor nomination system
but couldn't win any actual awards under Alternative Vote.

More detail on the voting system is available from the [Hugo Awards site](https://www.thehugoawards.org/the-voting-system/),
and original 2024 voting data is on the [Glasgow 2024 web site](https://glasgow2024.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024_hugo_statistics.pdf).

## FAQs

* Why doesn't X have a round 6?

Once a candidate has half the votes, counting stops: nobody else can win.

* Why are some of the candidates off to one side in the nominations?

This is a bug, the system used to generate the graph positions can't figure out how to position
a node where there are no flows to or from it.

* Why so few "No Transfers" for nominations?

We don't have data for nomination rounds except the last 10, which (typically) represents the
final 16 candidates. This means we don't know the total number of no transfers, so this is a
low number. Not displaying the transfers causes issues for the system used to generate the graphs.
(The candidate eliminated in the first displayed round would have the wrong number of points)

* Why isn't the nomination with the least points always eliminated?

E Pluribus Hugo eliminates whichever of the last two candidates has the least overall nominations, regardless
of points. This isn't shown on the graphs, but you can check the raw voting data to see it.
